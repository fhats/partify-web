Partify
*******

Partify is collaborative music management system designed to make listening to music in a shared environment fun and interactive.
By leveraging `Mopidy <http://mopidy.com>`_'s Spotify streaming capabilities, Partify can offer a vast music catalogue that can be reached
using only a web browser. Partify runs as a web server and relies on `Mopidy <http://mopidy.com>`_ to perform the music playback. Music is 
played to a single output and not streamed via the browser.

To get started, jump to the `installation <https://github.com/fxh32/partify/wiki/Installation>`_ docs.

Partify is designed to work on almost any platform that supports Python, but works best on \*nix and derivatives (such as OS X). 
For best results, Partify should be run on a media server that powers your speakers and is not visible outside your LAN.
